Just me playing around with some Gaia data release 1 with sample data centered around the Pleiades star cluster using matplotlib and astro.py

**Note:** The DR1 data used is in an ascii table. The data for DR1 is usually provided as a VOTable so you must convert it to ascii yourself (`astropy.io.ascii` and `astropy.io.votable` may come in handy)
